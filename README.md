# chatbot-personas

A simple Python chatbot that lets you choose a personality before chatting.  
Want advice from Sherlock Holmes? Wisdom from Yoda? Sarcasm from Tony Stark? Or guidance from Gandalf?  
This bot was built purely for fun, not as a serious project

##  Features
- Multiple personalities inspired by movies & books:
  - 🕵️ Sherlock Holmes (logical, deductive)
  - 🧙 Gandalf (epic, quest-like guidance)
  -  Yoda (short, wise, inverted speech)
  -  Tony Stark (witty, sarcastic, tech genius)
  - 🎩 Wonderland Guide (whimsical, curious metaphors)
- Runs in your terminal
- Secure API key handling with `.env`
- Built with OpenAI's GPT model
